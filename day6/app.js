// The goal of this project is to write a function that reverses the order of the array

// Step 1: Define the function
// Create a function called reverseArray that takes in an array as a parameter and returns a new
// array with the same elements in reverse order.
// Step 2: Test the function
// Test the reverseArray function with some sample arrays to see if it works correctly.
// Step 3: Implement the function as a method on the Array object
// You can also implement the reverseArray function as a method on the Array object so that you
// can use it directly on any array.
// Step 4: Test the method
// Test the reverseArray method by calling it on some sample arrays.
